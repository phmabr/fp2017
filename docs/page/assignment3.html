<dt>Delayed Submission</dt>
<dd>Each submission is weighed according to half-value period of 10 days. That means if you submit a perfect answer 30 days after the due date, you will receive <span class="math inline">\(1/8\)</span> the full points. In other words, you lose <span class="math inline">\(1 - 1/2^{1/10} \approx 6.7\text {%}\)</span> points each day after the due date has passed. It is very wise to keep the due date.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>

<h1 id="assignment">Assignment</h1>
<p>Answer either (or both) questions and submit your answer as a PDF document. If you answer both questions the better answer will be chosen for your evaluation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What’s <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-conversion for? What kind of problems we will see if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-conversion were not applied? Find Min-Caml programs that give incorrect answers in absence of proper <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-conversion.</p>
<p>Hint: You may want to consider the reason why <code>inline.ml</code> refers to <code>Alpha.g</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Are optimization modules interdependent? Yes, but in what way? Find a pair of optimization modules <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> such that for a program <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is effective when it is applied after <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[^\exists P. B(P) = P \text { but } B(A(P)) \not= A(P)\]</span></p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>The questions seem simple. If you think that they can be described in a short paragraph please think little bit more. Please at least take time to understand the schematic definitions. The implementation may give insight to those who are more implementation-oriented people. If you think enough you may discover more profound issues being questioned on you.</p>
